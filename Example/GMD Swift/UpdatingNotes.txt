1) How to add a missing icon

Fire up the demo app and click the warning icon to view glyphs which have not been matched with an enum

Hunt in here for the icon that is missing. Once you find it - get the codepoint
Now find the icon name in CMDIcons.swift - it should be in the list, but commented out
Add the code value
Send a pull request

Note - there are currently a lot of icons which don't have names (that I can find) on http://material.io
If you want to add on of these to the code, please give it a name in the format gmdSomeName_tmp
When/if we get an 'official' name for the item, I'll rename the _tmp one



2) How to update if the icon is not in the current ttf

Get the latest woff file from Google
Convert to ttf with https://everythingfonts.com/woff2-to-ttf

Array of iconNames can be scraped with the following js

//////////JS to scrape iconNames from https://material.io/tools/icons/?style=baseline
var x = document.getElementsByClassName("icon-image-preview");
var iconNames = []

for (var i=0; i<x.length; i++) {
var element = x[i];
var cName = element.classList[0].slice(9)
var parts = cName.split("_")
parts = parts.map(function(part){return part.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + part.substr(1);})

iconNames.push( ["gmd" + parts.join("")] )
};

console.log("["+iconNames.join()+"]")
//////////////

Update the array of iconNames in CaseGenerator.swift

CaseGenerator.swift will match these with the existing cases and output a new list of cases where the unmatched cases are commented out
This is run automatically when the demo project starts

Update the list of cases in GMDIcon.swift

Go back to step 1
